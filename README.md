# BBFuzzGun
A small container with tools offensive security tools to test https://github.com/echoCTF/echoCTF.RED before each release.

The initial idea for this was born out of the necesity to fuzz our projects before release in a context that not only discovers vulnerabilities but also misconfigurations, errors and crashes.
